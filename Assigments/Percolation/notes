In the percolation problem, I implemented the weighted union-find data structure to solve the problem.  The  simulation gives values around 0.6 which is what the sample simulations result in. The weighted union-find uses wighting by reducing the path from the leaf to the root of each conjugate set tree. As a result, finding root becomes easier. Further, we flatten the trees more by adding reassigning a node from its parent to its grandparent while finding its root. The time complexity is given by N+Mlog*N where log* is an iterative logarithm. Algorithm is close to (but no equal) to linear time. As a result,we can compute even upto 200 by 200 matrices within a few milliseconds.
