Iterables are data structures in java that are iterable without exposing the internal implementation. For example, a stack or a queue
is iterable data structure and provides for an iterator method inside that allows us to perform foreach operations and traverese over
all component elements. To implement an iterator, class must first be Iterable. To do this, add an "implements Iterable<Item>" along with 
the class definition. Inside the class, define a class of type iterator that returns a private class iterator object that you define. The 
class you define will implemnt 3 methods i.e. hasnext(), next() and remove() (We will not use remove() as prescribed in the course).
